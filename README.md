# Built with ReactJS and deployed with Zeit's Now

This was built during a training course - a real-time app for a trendy seafood market where price and quantity available are variable and can change at a moment's notice. I built a menu, an order form, and an inventory management area where authorized users can immediately update product details.

The initial load screen is blank, you'll need to build your store, but to see a built out version see below. You can only edit the inventory in your own store:
